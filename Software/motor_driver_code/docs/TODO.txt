1) Integrate GPIO user-friendly control
    -> integrate into hbridge.c, utils.c and stepper.c - DONE
    -> implement debug messages everywhere
    -> test if pins behave as they should have and if debug on uart0 works
2) Integrate standalone encoder (functions to be able to setup/read them)
3) Add switches support on the PORTA pins
4) Integrate the standard CAN protocol with basic functions (blink, switches, hbridge, stepper, encoder)
5) Combine the encoder with the stepper and hbridge (+ PID)
    -> add this function to CAN
6) Add ADC functionality on PORTA 
    -> add this function to CAN
